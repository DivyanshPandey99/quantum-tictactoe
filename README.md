# Quantum Tic-tac-toe
Quantum tic-tac-toe is a "quantum generalization" of tic-tac-toe in which the players' moves are "superpositions" of plays in the classical game.

Variant of the classical game, by allowing superpositions of standard moves, applying Quantum Computation.

Utilized Qiskit to implement Quantum Circuit, and using the concept of bringing Qubit into superposition state through the Hadamard Gate. 

Deployed and created web app using Streamlit framework.

### Instructions ###

|0> and |1> represent the piece chosen by the Computer and User respectively.

However, unlike the classical tic tac toe, there's not a 100% probability that when computer/user make their move, it will result into their respective move.

For eg, if user selects a piece, it's actually possible that the piece take the value of |0> and not |1>.

This is the Quantum effect of Quantum Superposition in the Quantum Tic Tac Toe!
